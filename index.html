                <h2>Our Story</h2>

                <p>Stephanie loves to write. It was this love of creative writing that drew her to use the dating site Okcupid as a platform for her short stories. Corey, using the site for its intended purpose, came across her profile and was immediately intrigued by her writing. He continued to visit the profile as much for the creepy stories that changed often as for the striking redhead authoring them. Stephanie, noting the frequency with which he visited her profile and the familiarity of his face, sent him a message asking if they knew each other. They did not, but that exchange led to a date over coffee at Bold Bean.  That first meeting was not a success; he thought her shifty, she thought him pompous and not her type.</p> 

                <p>“I wasn’t really impressed or impressing,” she recalls years later. But he was smitten with her, and she was interested enough that a friendship ensued.</p>

                <p>Stephanie tried fruitlessly to set Corey up on dates with friends, but he was only interested in her. He pursued her relentlessly. Once, Corey&mdash;a lover and collector of local art&mdash;left art on her porch to surprise her. A week after they met, he asked to meet her mother, Carolyn, and her daughter, Evelyn.  The meeting went well enough that Stephanie became aware she liked him more than she initially thought.  She loved how he was with her daughter and family and how dedicated he was to his own. They realized they were crazy about each other, and shortly after they began formally dating, found out they were expecting.</p>

                <p>They recently purchased a home in Avondale. They share their home with their two children, their dog Nickel, a group of monarch butterflies, and about a million succulents.</p>
